# NumberSorting
Small application that accepts 10 numeric entries, and sorts them into correct order.


This was originally created for one of my first university c# classes.

This takes an input of numbers (currently doesnt filter out letters) 10x, then sorts them into the correct order.

If I get around to it, there are a few things I'd like to improve:
1: Somehow streamline the requesting process for requesting user numbers to be less tediously slow?
2: Actually create something to catch non numeric entries
3: ???
4: Profit?
